# Labelbox_review
Demo: Auto Review for Labelbox document image

## Install the CLIP package.
CLIP models are available in the python package at [here](https://github.com/openai/CLIP). <br />
It depends on torch==1.7.1, which is not really necessary. We can ignore the dependency. <br />
```
pip install ftfy regex tqdm
pip install git+https://github.com/openai/CLIP.git  --no-dependencies
```
